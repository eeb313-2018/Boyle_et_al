# Introduction to the Project
Our project is attempting to investigate the change in size of aquatic predator and prey across latitude. Bergman's rule predicts that species will become larger at increased latitudes. We are investigating this because Bergman's rule is a generalisation that may not be true despite it being used in climate change analysis.

# Description of the Data
  This is a large dataset which principally investigates the change in body size parameters across trophic levels and latitude. Our main variables we anticipate using are taxon, life stage, length, mass, predator/prey, sea surface temperature, and latitude. At this point, we are chiefly interested in whether Bergman's rule is followed or not and if higher diversity is correlated with lower latitude. Taxon information and latitude information will be used for diversity, while latitude and body size will be used for testing Bergman's rule.

# Team Description
  Cole Brookson - Is well organised and ensures that projects are kept on track. Very good with figures. Will be responsible for figures.

  Julia Boyle - Very punctual. Always keeps things on track. Good at noticing errors in code. Will clean data initially, help with correcting final code errors.

  Duncan Martin - Well organised and good at data fitting and finding errors in models. Will be responsible for models and model analysis (with Cole).

  Dale Pebesma - Good at analysing general models and creating many at once. Will be responsible for the general models.
