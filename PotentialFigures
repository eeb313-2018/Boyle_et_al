1. A series of maps showing how different trait combinations and predator prey combinations are distributed across a series of abiotic 
variables/predictors - this will help visualize how traits and food webs are distributed over space 
2. A series of plots showing how well different traits predict different trophic functional groups (PCA results) 
3. A series of diagrams (not plots) indicating how different traits are related to different phylogenetic groupings and what
they tell us about predator-prey relationships 
4. Histograms of how different traits (i.e. length) are distributed across the region 
5. Likely there will be more figures depending on how our results turn out
